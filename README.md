### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My Name is Ankita Kumari !

**Academic Transitional Journey : From the lab bench to the computer.**<br />

I am a Bioinformatics Analyst passionate about leveraging computational tools to gain insights into biological systems. 
With a strong background in biomedical science, I have transitioned into bioinformatics to bridge the gap between wet lab research and computational analysis.

I am committed to open science and reproducibility, working extensively with high-throughput sequencing and other omics technologies to analyze large-scale biological datasets.


- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning nextflow, FISH & exploring Data Science at command line.
- Focus: Bash, Linux, Nextflow, Python, R & Bioinformatics Pipelines.
